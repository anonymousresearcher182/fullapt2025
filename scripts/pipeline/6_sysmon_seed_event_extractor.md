```

### Extraction Funnel Visualization

The extraction process progressively narrows from all Sysmon events to analyst-marked seed events, creating a focused dataset of significant attack indicators.

![Figure 6.1: Target Event Filtering Logic](figures/figure_6_1_filtering_funnel.png)
**Figure 6.1**: Funnel diagram showing the four-stage filtering process. Starting with 145,832 raw Sysmon events (all EventIDs), the script filters to 47,899 target events (EventID 1, 11, 23 only - 32.8% retained). Analysts then review these events and mark 215 as seed events (0.14% of original dataset). The narrow focus on seed events enables efficient human-in-the-loop labeling while capturing critical attack operations.

### EventID Distribution in Extracted Events

The distribution of extracted events reflects the nature of attack activities, with process execution (EventID 1) dominating, followed by file operations.

![Figure 6.3: EventID Distribution in Target Events](figures/figure_6_3_target_eventid_pie.png)
**Figure 6.3**: Pie chart showing the breakdown of extracted target events by EventID type. Process Creation (EventID 1) comprises 59.4% (28,456 events), File Creation (EventID 11) comprises 31.9% (15,287 events), and File Deletion (EventID 23) comprises 8.7% (4,156 events). This distribution guides analysts toward the most informationally-rich event types for seed selection.

## Manual Selection Workflow

The manual selection workflow involves opening the extracted events CSV, reviewing attack indicators, marking seed events with MITRE ATT&CK labels, and saving the annotated dataset for lifecycle tracing.

![Figure 6.2: Manual Selection Workflow](figures/figure_6_2_manual_workflow.png)
**Figure 6.2**: Flowchart illustrating the analyst workflow for manual seed event selection. Starting with the extracted target events CSV, analysts review command lines and file operations, identify significant attack behaviors, mark seed events with 'x', annotate with MITRE ATT&CK tactic/technique labels, save the file, and optionally re-run the extractor to preserve selections. This human-in-the-loop process ensures high-quality ground truth labels for attack lifecycle tracing.

### Step 1: Open CSV File
Open `all_target_events_run-XX.csv` in Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or any CSV editor.

### Step 2: Review Event Data
Examine the following columns to identify attack-related events:
- **CommandLine**: Look for suspicious commands, PowerShell execution, reconnaissance
- **TargetFilename**: Identify malware staging, persistence files, exfiltration archives
- **Computer**: Track which hosts are compromised
- **timestamp_h**: Understand temporal attack progression

### Step 3: Mark Seed Events
For events that represent significant attack operations:
- **Seed_Event column**: Enter **'x'** (lowercase x) to mark as seed event
- **Tactic column**: Enter MITRE ATT&CK tactic (e.g., `initial-access`, `discovery`, `exfiltration`)
- **Technique column**: Enter MITRE ATT&CK technique ID (e.g., `T1059.001`, `T1016`, `T1041`)

### Step 4: Save and Re-run
- Save the CSV file (preserve CSV format)
- Re-run the script to preserve your selections while refreshing other data
- Selections are preserved by matching `RawDatasetRowNumber`

### Example Marking
```csv
Seed_Event,Tactic,Technique,RawDatasetRowNumber,timestamp_h,EventID,CommandLine
x,initial-access,T1659,487566,2025-05-24 23:19:21.858,11,C:\Users\Public\sandcat.exe
x,execution,T1059.001,601019,2025-05-24 23:20:58.619,1,cmd.exe /C powershell.exe;if ($?) {...}
x,discovery,T1016,781971,2025-05-24 23:22:49.443,1,cmd.exe /C ipconfig /all
x,collection,T1119,685699,2025-05-24 23:22:01.255,1,powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -C "$env:APPDATA;$files=..."
x,exfiltration,T1041,919714,2025-05-24 23:24:49.316,1,powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -C "Import-Module .\upload.ps1..."
```

## Integration with Pipeline

### Input Dependencies
**Step 2 Output**: Raw Sysmon CSV (sysmon-run-XX.csv)
**Required Structure**: `dataset/apt-X/apt-X-run-XX/` directories

### Output Integration
**Next Step (Step 7)**: Attack Lifecycle Tracer uses `all_target_events_run-XX.csv` with marked seed events
**Manual Process**: Analyst reviews and marks seed events between Steps 6 and 7

**Data Flow**:
```
Raw Sysmon CSV â†’ Event Extraction â†’ Manual Marking â†’ Attack Lifecycle Tracing
     (Step 2)         (Step 6)      [Human Analysis]         (Step 7)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Metrics
- **Runtime**: 10-60 seconds per APT run (depends on dataset size)
- **Memory Usage**: 500MB - 2GB (scales with Sysmon event count)
- **Extraction Rate**: Typically 20-40% of total Sysmon events
- **EventID Distribution**: ~60% EventID 1, ~30% EventID 11, ~10% EventID 23

### Scalability
- **Small Datasets**: 10K-50K Sysmon events â†’ ~3K-15K target events
- **Medium Datasets**: 50K-200K Sysmon events â†’ ~15K-60K target events
- **Large Datasets**: 200K+ Sysmon events â†’ ~60K+ target events
- **Re-run Performance**: Fast (selections preserved, no re-analysis needed)

## Selection Preservation

### How It Works
1. When re-running the script, it checks if output file already exists
2. Reads existing file and extracts all Seed_Event/Tactic/Technique selections
3. Uses `RawDatasetRowNumber` as unique key to match selections
4. Applies preserved selections to newly extracted events
5. Reports number of selections preserved

### Benefits
- **Iterative Workflow**: Refine selections across multiple sessions
- **Safe Re-runs**: Won't lose manual work if script is re-executed
- **Data Updates**: Can refresh timestamp formatting or column structure while keeping selections
- **Collaboration**: Multiple analysts can work on different time windows
